# DockCoV2
The current state of the COVID-19 pandemic is a global health crisis. To fight the novel coronavirus, one of the best known ways is to block enzymes essential for virus replications. Currently, we know that the SARS-CoV-2 genome contains about 30,000 nucleotides that encode for proteins including spike, 3C-like protease (3CLpro), RNA-dependent RNA polymerase (RdRp), and Papain-like protease (PLpro). To date, various studies have shown that the surface spike protein plays a critical role in virus entry through the process of binding to host receptors such as the angiotensin-converting enzyme 2 (ACE2). In order to speed up the discovery of therapeutic agents, we develop DockCoV2, a drug database for SARS-CoV2. DockCoV2 focuses on predicting the binding affinity of FDA-approved and Taiwan National Health Insurance (NHI) drugs with the five proteins mentioned above. This database contains a total of 3,109 drugs, including 2,285 FDA-approved and 1,478 NHI drugs. DockCoV2 is easy to use and search against, is well cross-linked to external databases, and provides state-of-the-art prediction results in one site. Users can download their drug-protein docking data of interest, as well as many other drug-related information. Furthermore, DockCoV2 provides validation information to help users understand which drugs have already been reported to be effective against MERS or SARS-CoV.
